/// Checkpoint Policy System (Not Consensus Rules)
///
/// Checkpoints are POLICY-LEVEL protections, NOT consensus rules.
/// They provide additional security for:
/// - Mining pools (prevent deep reorg attacks on payouts)
/// - Exchanges (safe confirmation depth for deposits)
/// - Block explorers (stable reference points)
///
/// Effects:
/// - Prevents long-range history rewrite attacks
/// - Provides network stability during early mainnet phase
/// - Gives social consensus anchor points
///
/// Important: Checkpoints do NOT affect the validity of blocks themselves.
/// They only affect chain selection policy in this specific node implementation.

/// Checkpoint: Policy-level chain anchor point
/// Format: (block_height, block_hash)
